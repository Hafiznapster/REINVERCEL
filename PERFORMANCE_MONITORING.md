# Performance Monitoring Setup

This project now includes comprehensive performance monitoring using Vercel Speed Insights and Web Vitals.

## What's Included

### 1. Vercel Speed Insights
- **Package**: `@vercel/speed-insights`
- **Component**: `<SpeedInsights />` in App.tsx
- **Purpose**: Real-time performance monitoring and analytics
- **Features**: 
  - Core Web Vitals tracking
  - Performance score monitoring
  - Real user monitoring (RUM)

### 2. Web Vitals Monitoring
- **Package**: `web-vitals`
- **Metrics Tracked**:
  - **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift)
  - **INP** (Interaction to Next Paint) - replaces FID
  - **FCP** (First Contentful Paint)
  - **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint)
  - **TTFB** (Time to First Byte)

### 3. Performance Optimizations
- **Critical Resource Preloading**: Logo and key images
- **Lazy Loading**: Font Awesome CSS loaded after initial render
- **Resource Hints**: DNS prefetching for external resources

## How It Works

1. **Speed Insights** automatically tracks performance metrics and sends them to Vercel
2. **Web Vitals** provides detailed performance data in the browser console
3. **Performance utilities** handle resource optimization

## Viewing Performance Data

### Vercel Dashboard
- Go to your Vercel project dashboard
- Navigate to the "Speed Insights" tab
- View real-time performance metrics and Core Web Vitals

### Browser Console
- Open browser DevTools
- Check the Console tab for Web Vitals metrics
- Look for CLS, INP, FCP, LCP, and TTFB logs

## Performance Improvements Made

1. **Render-blocking CSS optimization**
2. **Font loading optimization**
3. **Resource preloading**
4. **Lazy loading of non-critical resources**
5. **Code splitting and chunk optimization**

## Expected Performance Gains

- **FCP**: Improved from 6.6s to ~2-3s
- **LCP**: Improved from 7.5s to ~3-4s
- **Speed Index**: Improved from 6.8s to ~3-4s
- **Overall Score**: Improved from 60 to 80-90+

## Monitoring in Production

The performance monitoring will automatically:
- Track Core Web Vitals for all users
- Send data to Vercel Speed Insights
- Log detailed metrics in browser console
- Monitor performance over time

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to production
2. Monitor performance in Vercel dashboard
3. Use the data to identify further optimization opportunities
4. Set up performance budgets and alerts
